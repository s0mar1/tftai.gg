# TFT Meta Analyzer Site Functionality Test Report

**Test Date:** 2025-07-18
**Test Environment:** http://localhost:5174 (Frontend), http://localhost:5001 (Backend)

## Executive Summary

The site has **critical issues** preventing proper functionality:

- ❌ **Backend API is completely down** (Connection refused on port 5001)
- ❌ **Frontend has 100+ errors** due to missing API and WebSocket issues
- ❌ **Data loading fails** on all pages
- ✅ **Frontend server is running** and pages are accessible
- ✅ **Navigation structure exists** with proper links

## Detailed Test Results

### 1. Backend API Status
**Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL FAILURE**

- API health check failed: `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` on http://localhost:5001/api/health
- **The backend server is not running or not accessible on port 5001**
- All API calls from frontend are failing

### 2. Frontend Server
**Status:** ⚠️ **Partially Working**

- ✅ Frontend server is running on port 5174
- ✅ Pages are loading (HTML structure)
- ❌ All data fetching fails due to backend being down
- ❌ WebSocket errors to port 5173 (likely HMR/dev server issues)

### 3. Homepage
**Status:** ⚠️ **Loads but without data**

- ✅ Page structure loads
- ✅ Navigation menu is present with 8 links
- ❌ TFTDataContext errors: "Failed to fetch"
- ❌ Static data loading fails
- ❌ Multiple network failures for API endpoints

### 4. Navigation Structure
**Status:** ✅ **Working**

Found navigation links:
- 추천 메타 → /tierlist
- 덱공략 → /guides  
- 랭킹 → /ranking
- 상세 통계 → /stats
- 덱 빌더 → /deck-builder
- AI 질문하기 → /ai-chat
- About TFTai.gg → /about

### 5. Tier List Page
**Status:** ⚠️ **Page loads but no data**

- ✅ Navigation to /tierlist works
- ✅ Page structure loads
- ❌ Deck data fails to load: `/api/tierlist/decks/ko` returns 404
- ❌ Multiple retry attempts all fail

### 6. Stats Page
**Status:** ❌ **Navigation link missing**

- ❌ Stats navigation link not found in the current navigation structure
- The link text "상세 통계" exists but may not be properly linked

### 7. API Endpoints Failing

All API calls are failing with various errors:

1. **Static Data APIs (port 4001):**
   - `/api/static-data/items-by-category/ko` - ERR_ABORTED
   - `/api/static-data/tft-data/ko` - ERR_ABORTED

2. **Main APIs (port 5001):**
   - `/api/health` - ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
   - Backend server not responding

3. **Frontend API Proxy:**
   - `/api/tierlist/decks/ko` - 404 Not Found

### 8. Console Errors Summary

- **WebSocket errors:** Failed connection to ws://localhost:5173
- **TFTDataContext errors:** Multiple "Failed to fetch" errors
- **Network failures:** 100+ failed resource loads

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Backend Server is Down**
   - The main backend server on port 5001 is not running
   - This causes all API functionality to fail

2. **Port Configuration Issues**
   - Frontend expects APIs on multiple ports (4001, 5001)
   - API proxy configuration may be incorrect

3. **Development Server Issues**
   - WebSocket connection failures suggest HMR/dev server problems
   - Multiple resource loading failures

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Start the Backend Server:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Check Backend Logs:**
   - Review backend.log for startup errors
   - Ensure database connection is working
   - Verify all environment variables are set

3. **Verify Port Configuration:**
   - Ensure backend is configured to run on port 5001
   - Check if port 4001 service needs to be running
   - Update frontend proxy configuration if needed

4. **Fix API Routing:**
   - The frontend is making calls to `/api/` which get 404 errors
   - Check if API proxy is properly configured in vite.config.js

## Conclusion

The site's frontend infrastructure is working, but it's completely non-functional due to the backend being down. No features can be tested properly until the backend server is running and API connectivity is restored.
